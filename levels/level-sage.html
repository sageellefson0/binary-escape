                    Shuttle Orbiter Columbia (NASA Designation: OV-102) was the oldest <span>space shuttle</span> in <span>NASA</span>'s fleet, first flying mission <span>STS-1</span> from <span>April 12</span> to <span>April 14, 1981</span>. It was lost with all crew on re-entry on its 28th mission, <span>STS-107</span>, which lasted from <span>January 16</span> to February 1, 2003.

                    After being constructed, the orbiter arrived at John F. Kennedy Space Center on March 25, 1979 to be prepared for its first launch. However, before its first mission three workers were killed and five injured during a ground test of the orbiter on March 19, 1981.

                    The first flight of Columbia was commanded by John Young (a space veteran from the Gemini and Apollo eras) and piloted by Robert Crippen a rookie who had never been in space before, but who served as support crew for the Skylab missions and Apollo-Soyuz.

                    In 1983 Columbia launched the first mission (STS-9) with 6 astronauts, including the first non-American astronaut, Ulf Merbold, from Germany on a space shuttle. On January 12, 1986 Columbia took off with the first Hispanic-American astronaut, Dr. Franklin R. Chang-Diaz. Another first was announced on March 5, 1998 when NASA named their choice of United States Air Force Lt. Col. Eileen Collins as commander of a future Columbia mission making Collins the first woman commander of a space shuttle mission. On its final mission the craft was carrying the first Israeli astronaut, Ilan Ramon and the first woman astronaut of Indian birth, Kalpana Chawla. Other crew members on the final flight included Rick Husband (commander), Willie McCool (pilot), Michael P. Anderson, Laurel Clark, and David Brown.

                    On the morning of February 1, 2003, the shuttle re-entered the atmosphere after a 16-day scientific mission. NASA lost radio contact at about 9 a.m. EST, only minutes before the expected 09:16 landing at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Video recordings show the craft breaking up in flames over Texas, at an altitude of approximately 39 miles (63 km) and a speed of 12,500 mph (20,000 km/h).
